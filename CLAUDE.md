# Stockly — Gamified Stock Learning App

## Project Origin
Originally built as "StockQuest" in a single Claude Code session. Rebranded and redesigned as **Stockly** starting 2026-04-22. The vision is a Duolingo-style stock education platform built for people who were never given access to financial education — especially women, young adults, and first-gen wealth builders.

## What This App Is
A mobile-first, beginner-friendly stock education app. Bright, interactive, and welcoming — feels like playing, not studying. Full 14-screen onboarding flow routes users into a personalized learning track. All state stored in localStorage, no backend required. Fully responsive — desktop view has a persistent sidebar, mobile uses a hamburger drawer.

## Brand
- **Name**: Stockly
- **Tagline**: Learning stocks, simplified.
- **Tone**: Warm, professional, judgment-free. A smart friend explaining things — not a professor. No slang, no talking down.
- **Inspired by**: Duolingo (interaction style, celebrations, streaks), You Deserve to Be Rich (wealth mindset content)
- **Mascot**: Gender-neutral cute bull 🐂 — Duo energy. Full illustrated mascot TBD (commission a designer or use Fiverr/Adobe Express). Emoji placeholder currently in use.
- **Logo**: SVG S-mark — purple ribbon S with candlestick charts overlaid, arrow at top. Lives in `components/StocklyLogo.tsx`. Used inline with "tockly" text as wordmark.

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **No backend** — zero infrastructure, works offline
- **SSR-safe** — all localStorage reads inside useEffect or guarded with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`
- **Terms stored with timestamp + UUID** — `stockly_terms_agreed` provides legal proof of agreement
- **Pure functions** — `lib/gameState.ts` has zero React imports
- **Storage key versioned** — `stockgame_v1`
- **Responsive layout** — `app/layout.tsx` wraps all pages in `md:flex`; `DesktopSidebar` is `hidden md:flex` (fixed, 240px); main content is `md:ml-60`. Mobile-first, desktop-enhanced.

## Lesson System

### Shared Types (`lib/starter-lessons.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces: `SlideType`, `QuizSlide`, `Slide`, `Lesson`, `Unit`
- `Unit` interface fields: `id`, `title`, `subtitle`, `color`, `borderColor`, `lessons[]`

### Slide Types
`'intro'` | `'text'` | `'fact'` | `'tap-reveal'` | `'quiz'` | `'complete'` | `'chart-demo'`

`chart-demo` slides reference a `demoType` string that maps to a self-contained interactive component in `DemoSlide.tsx`. Always advanceable (no gate).

### LessonPlayer Component (`components/LessonPlayer.tsx`)
- Renders all 7 slide types with animations
- Progress bar at top, haptics on every interaction
- Confetti (`celebrateCorrect()`) on correct quiz answers, shake animation on wrong
- Continue button disabled until required interaction (tap-reveal = must tap, quiz = must answer)
- Props: `lesson`, `onComplete(xp)`, `backHref`

### Interactive Demo Slides (`components/DemoSlide.tsx`)
8 self-contained interactive demos:

| demoType | Track | Lesson | What the user does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `company-split` | Starter | Pizza Shop | Order ticket — enter 5 of 100 shares, see ownership math live, review + confirm |
| `supply-demand` | Starter | Who's Buying & Selling | Add buyers/sellers, watch price direction animate |
| `savings-vs-investing` | Starter | Saving vs Investing | Drag 30-year slider, watch investing bar dwarf savings bar |
| `dca` | Starter | Starting Small | Tap to invest $50 each week, average cost calculates live |
| `price-range` | Builder | Read a Stock Page | Tap Low/Mid/High, price marker slides along 52-week range |
| `bull-bear` | Builder/Leveler | Bull vs Bear / Market Cycles | Tap through 4 market phases, SVG chart redraws |
| `portfolio-bars` | Builder | Building a Portfolio | Toggle diversification, watch risk meter change color |
| `candlestick-anatomy` | Leveler | How to Read a Price Chart | SVG candlestick with labeled arrows — tap HIGH/CLOSE/OPEN/LOW to highlight and explain each part |

**Candlestick anatomy demo specifics** (`candlestick-anatomy`):
- Large green candlestick SVG with upper wick, body, lower wick
- Static gray labels on LEFT: "Wick" and "Body" with dashed leader lines
- Interactive labels on RIGHT: HIGH, CLOSE, OPEN, LOW with left-pointing arrowheads landing at exact candle points
- Tapping a label highlights that candle part, fades everything else, slides up an explanation card
- Caption notes this is a green candle (price went up during the period)

### Starter Track (`lib/starter-lessons.ts`)
- 4 units, 17 lessons
- Final lesson ID: `u4-l5`
- Progress key: `stockly_starter_progress` | XP key: `stockly_starter_xp`

### Builder Track (`lib/builder-lessons.ts`)
- 3 units, 13 lessons
- Final lesson ID: `b3-l5`
- Progress key: `stockly_builder_progress` | XP key: `stockly_builder_xp`

### Leveler Track (`lib/leveler-lessons.ts`)
- 3 units, 14 lessons covering: candlestick reading, support/resistance, volume, short vs long term, 1% rule, stop loss/take profit, manipulation, earnings reports, market cycles, strategy building
- Final lesson ID: `lv3-l5` — completing this unlocks Wealth Building
- Progress key: `stockly_leveler_progress` | XP key: `stockly_leveler_xp`
- Track home: `app/learn/leveler/page.tsx`
- Lesson route: `app/learn/leveler/lesson/[lessonId]/page.tsx`

### Track Page Pattern (all 3 tracks use identical structure)
- Header: StocklyLogo + wordmark (left), ✕ button routes to `/learn` (right)
- Track hero card: emoji, title, description, overall progress bar
- Unit sections with colored header cards (`color` + `borderColor` from Unit data)
- Lesson nodes: locked (🔒) / available (purple border, →) / complete (✅, green border, ★)
- Lessons unlock sequentially — previous must be complete
- Completion banner fires when all lessons done
- Content area: `max-w-sm mx-auto md:max-w-2xl`

### localStorage Keys (lesson progress)
| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `stockly_starter_progress` | `{ [lessonId]: true }` |
| `stockly_starter_xp` | Total XP earned (number string) |
| `stockly_builder_progress` | `{ [lessonId]: true }` |
| `stockly_builder_xp` | Total XP earned (number string) |
| `stockly_leveler_progress` | `{ [lessonId]: true }` |
| `stockly_leveler_xp` | Total XP earned (number string) |

## Navigation System

### `/learn` Dashboard (`app/learn/page.tsx`)
- Main menu showing all 4 tracks as cards
- Lock/unlock logic:
  - Starter: always available
  - Builder: unlocks if `stockly_level` is `builder`/`leveler` OR starter final lesson (`u4-l5`) is complete
  - Leveler: unlocks if `stockly_level` is `leveler` OR builder final lesson (`b3-l5`) is complete
  - Wealth: unlocks after leveler final lesson (`lv3-l5`) is complete
- Per-track progress bars + XP display, total XP in header
- Mobile header (hamburger + logo + XP) hidden on desktop via `md:hidden`
- Track grid: `flex flex-col md:grid md:grid-cols-2` — 2 columns on desktop
- "Coming Soon" badge for Wealth Building (not yet built)

### Desktop Sidebar (`components/DesktopSidebar.tsx`)
- `hidden md:flex` — only visible on desktop (md: and above)
- Fixed position, 240px wide (`w-60`), full height, `bg-brand-surface` with right border
- Contains: Stockly logo/wordmark (links to `/learn`), nav items, Upgrade to Pro link, total XP, user avatar + name + plan, Sign Out
- Nav items: My Tracks, Glossary, Settings, About, Contact
- Active route highlighted with purple background
- XP and user data refresh on every route change (reads localStorage on `pathname` change)

### `HamburgerMenu` Component (`components/HamburgerMenu.tsx`)
- Mobile-only, dashboard-only (not shown on track or lesson pages)
- Slide-in drawer from left, backdrop tap to close
- Same nav links as DesktopSidebar
- Sign Out at the bottom

### Track Pages (Starter, Builder, Leveler)
- No hamburger menu — focused learning experience
- Header: StocklyLogo + ✕ button that routes to `/learn`

### Supporting Pages
- `/glossary` — 60+ terms across 6 categories (Basics, Market, Trading, Analysis, Risk, Advanced). Searchable + filterable. Accordion expand. Includes "Ceiling" (resistance synonym).
- `/about` — Mission and what Stockly does
- `/contact` — Contact form + direct email (`hello@stockly.app`)
- `/settings` — Name edit, plan display, reset progress (clears all `stockly_*_progress` + `stockly_*_xp` keys), sign out

### `getResumeRoute()` (in `lib/auth.ts`)
- Enrolled users always land on `/learn` dashboard

## What To Do Next
1. **Build Wealth Building track** — 6 lessons, unlocks after `lv3-l5`
2. **Deploy to Vercel** — app is feature-complete enough to ship
3. Wire `enrollmentComplete` flag when a track is finished
4. Redesign legacy `/simulator` + `/challenge` pages with Money Moves color system
5. Commission final bull mascot illustration
