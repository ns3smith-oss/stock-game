# Stockly — Gamified Stock Learning App

## Project Origin
Originally built as "StockQuest" in a single Claude Code session. Rebranded and redesigned as **Stockly** starting 2026-04-22. The vision is a Duolingo-style stock education platform built for people who were never given access to financial education — especially women, young adults, and first-gen wealth builders.

## What This App Is
A mobile-first, beginner-friendly stock education app. Bright, interactive, and welcoming — feels like playing, not studying. Full 14-screen onboarding flow routes users into a personalized learning track. All state stored in localStorage, no backend required.

## Brand
- **Name**: Stockly
- **Tagline**: Learning stocks, simplified.
- **Tone**: Warm, professional, judgment-free. A smart friend explaining things — not a professor. No slang, no talking down.
- **Inspired by**: Duolingo (interaction style, celebrations, streaks), You Deserve to Be Rich (wealth mindset content)
- **Mascot**: Gender-neutral cute bull 🐂 — Duo energy. Full illustrated mascot TBD (commission a designer or use Fiverr/Adobe Express). Emoji placeholder currently in use.
- **Logo**: SVG S-mark — purple ribbon S with candlestick charts overlaid, arrow at top. Lives in `components/StocklyLogo.tsx`. Used inline with "tockly" text as wordmark.

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **No backend** — zero infrastructure, works offline
- **SSR-safe** — all localStorage reads inside useEffect or guarded with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`
- **Terms stored with timestamp + UUID** — `stockly_terms_agreed` provides legal proof of agreement
- **Pure functions** — `lib/gameState.ts` has zero React imports
- **Storage key versioned** — `stockgame_v1`

## Lesson System — Starter Track (BUILT)

### Data (`lib/starter-lessons.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces: `SlideType`, `QuizSlide`, `Slide`, `Lesson`, `Unit`
- `STARTER_UNITS` array — 4 units, 17 lessons, fully written educational content
- Unit 1: What is a Stock? (pizza shop analogy, real ownership, IPOs, unit quiz)
- Unit 2: How the Market Works (NYSE/Nasdaq, buyers/sellers, price movement, unit quiz)
- Unit 3: Getting Started (brokers, SIPC protection, how to buy, portfolios, ETFs, unit quiz)
- Unit 4: Money & Risk (saving vs investing, inflation, fear/crashes, 1-2% rule, DCA, fractional shares, final quiz)

### Slide Types
`'intro'` | `'text'` | `'fact'` | `'tap-reveal'` | `'quiz'` | `'complete'` | `'chart-demo'`

`chart-demo` slides reference a `demoType` string that maps to a self-contained interactive component in `DemoSlide.tsx`. Always advanceable (no gate).

### LessonPlayer Component (`components/LessonPlayer.tsx`)
- Renders all 7 slide types with animations
- Progress bar at top, haptics on every interaction
- Confetti (`celebrateCorrect()`) on correct quiz answers, shake animation on wrong
- Continue button disabled until required interaction (tap-reveal = must tap, quiz = must answer)
- Props: `lesson`, `onComplete(xp)`, `backHref`

### Interactive Demo Slides (`components/DemoSlide.tsx`)
7 self-contained interactive demos inserted after key explanatory slides:

| demoType | Lesson | What the user does |
|---|---|---|
| `company-split` | Pizza Shop | Order ticket for Pizza Shop Inc. — enter 5 of 100 shares, see ownership math live, review + confirm order |
| `supply-demand` | Who's Buying & Selling | Add buyers/sellers, watch price direction animate in real time |
| `savings-vs-investing` | Saving vs Investing | Drag 30-year slider, watch investing bar dwarf savings bar |
| `dca` | Starting Small | Tap to invest $50 each week, average cost calculates live |
| `price-range` | Read a Stock Page | Tap Low/Mid/High, price marker slides along 52-week range |
| `bull-bear` | Bull vs Bear Markets | Tap through all 4 market phases, mini SVG chart redraws |
| `portfolio-bars` | Building a Portfolio | Toggle diversification, watch risk meter change color |

**Order ticket demo specifics** (`company-split`):
- Purple callout: "100 total shares. Buy 5 to see what you own."
- Input turns green + checkmark when user hits target (5)
- Live panel shows `{x} ÷ 100 shares` math as they type
- Review screen: "Shares buying: 5 of 100" + ownership calc
- Confirmed screen: callout connects to the quiz that follows
- Pizza Shop lesson reordered: explain → demo → quiz → tap-reveal → complete

### Builder Track (BUILT — `lib/builder-lessons.ts`)
- 3 units, 13 lessons covering: investment types, reading stock pages, bull/bear markets, company research, diversification, risk/reward, order types, first trade, portfolio building
- Same sequential unlock system, XP tracking (`stockly_builder_xp`), progress (`stockly_builder_progress`)
- Track home: `app/learn/builder/page.tsx` — hamburger removed, ✕ routes to `/learn`
- Lesson route: `app/learn/builder/lesson/[lessonId]/page.tsx`
- Final lesson ID: `b3-l5`

### Starter Track Home (`app/learn/starter/page.tsx`)
- Shows all 4 units with colored section headers
- Lesson nodes: locked (🔒) → available → complete (✅)
- Lessons unlock sequentially — complete one to unlock the next
- Overall progress bar with % complete + lesson count
- Progress stored in `stockly_starter_progress` (localStorage)

### Lesson Route (`app/learn/starter/lesson/[lessonId]/page.tsx`)
- Dynamic route — looks up lesson by ID from `STARTER_UNITS`
- On complete: saves to `stockly_starter_progress`, adds XP to `stockly_starter_xp`
- Milestone celebration at 100 XP (haptics.levelUp + celebrateLevelUp)
- Routes back to `/learn/starter` on completion

### localStorage Keys (lesson progress)
| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `stockly_starter_progress` | `{ [lessonId]: true }` — which lessons are complete |
| `stockly_starter_xp` | Total XP earned in starter track (number string) |

## Navigation System (BUILT)

### `/learn` Dashboard (`app/learn/page.tsx`)
- Main menu showing all 4 tracks as cards: Starter, Builder, Leveler, Wealth Building
- Lock/unlock logic:
  - Starter: always available
  - Builder: unlocks if `stockly_level` is `builder`/`leveler` OR starter final lesson (`u4-l5`) is complete
  - Leveler: unlocks if `stockly_level` is `leveler` OR builder final lesson (`b3-l5`) is complete
  - Wealth: unlocks after leveler final lesson (`lv3-l5`) is complete
- Per-track progress bars + XP display, total XP in header
- "Coming Soon" badge for tracks not yet built

### `HamburgerMenu` Component (`components/HamburgerMenu.tsx`)
- Slide-in drawer from left, backdrop tap to close
- Shows user name + Free/Pro plan badge
- Links: My Tracks → `/learn`, Upgrade to Pro → `/onboarding/plan`, Glossary → `/glossary`, Settings → `/settings`, About → `/about`, Contact → `/contact`
- Sign Out at the bottom (calls `signOut()`, routes to `/`)

### Supporting Pages
- `/glossary` — 60+ terms across 6 categories (Basics, Market, Trading, Analysis, Risk, Advanced). Searchable + filterable by category. Accordion expand.
- `/about` — Mission and what Stockly does
- `/contact` — Contact form + direct email
- `/settings` — Name edit, plan display, reset progress, sign out

### `getResumeRoute()` updated
- Enrolled users now always land on `/learn` dashboard instead of a specific track

### Track ✕ buttons
- Both Starter and Builder track home pages now route ✕ → `/learn`

## What To Do Next
1. Build Leveler track lesson content + routes (same pattern as Starter/Builder)
2. Build Wealth Building closer track (unlocks after Leveler)
3. Wire `enrollmentComplete` flag after all lessons in a track are done
4. Redesign legacy simulator + challenge pages with Money Moves color system
5. Commission final bull mascot illustration
6. Deploy to Vercel
